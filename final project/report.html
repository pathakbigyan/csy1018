<h2>Getting Started: </h2>
<p>
I collected the general idea by looking others websites, templets and video to develop my first term project of developing a cv-website. First I spend my time to sketch my site wireframe. I developed my cv-website using HTML and CSS (HTML5 and CSS3 properties), but I found most of website was developed by using Bootstrap, Jquary and other programming language. 

Pradeeprajthapaliya.com.np is the website from where I collected the general idea. </p>

<p>This is my logo  for my cv-website. The logo was made from designimo.com 

And I make a some change from photoshop (like saturation....). The Logo holds my name  

Navigation 

Navigation bar is one of the most important part of website. Navigation contain home, about, cv 

social, contact and report in our project. Navigation is a section containing web pages.  </p>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

        Then I started learn more about HTML tags,  CSS properties, class and object. Learn photoshop to make a logo and other image. Then after I able to make my simple home page(I.e. index page). 

 </p>

<h2>Intermediate</h2>

I made my section with 3 main div, containing photo which make you easy to know your current page. Section also containing my photo and some text with animations.

<h2>Advance</h2>
<p>In advanced, I have worked for animation and responsive of my site. </p>
<h3>Part1:Animation</h3>
<p>I have used the animation in many place in logo, navigation and footer etc... I simply used hover effect, transform properties and transition properties in my website. Animation is one of the main part in web site, it helps to make a page more attractive. Animation helps to make busy user and user spend more time in our website. </p>

My portfolio is look same in pcs and tablets but different in mobile. In mobile the logo display in full width and navigation display in column format. Section and footer is also display in column format. </p>
